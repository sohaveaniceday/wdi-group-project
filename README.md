# General Assembly WDI Project 3: A MERN Stack App

[Portfolio Link](https://munch-ga.herokuapp.com/)

Munch was the first MERN stack app I had built. It incorporated everything we had learned in the previous 8 weeks, including React, JavaScript and MongoDB.

---

## Brief

In 9 days and in groups of 4 we had to:

* **Build a full-stack application** by making your own backend and your own front-end
* **Use an Express API** to serve your data from a Mongo database
* **Consume your API with a separate front-end** built with React
* **Be a complete product** which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
* Consume at least **one public API** to enhance your app
* **Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes** that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut
* **Be deployed online** so it's publicly accessible.

## Technologies Used:

* JavaScript
* React
* HTML
* CSS
* Sass
* Node.js
* Mongoose
* Express
* Axios
* Filestack
* Yarn
* Bulma

## Approach Taken

In our team of 4 we created Munch, a social networking site for foodies, bringing together restaurant reviews and recipes all in one place. My part in the project included building the models in Node.js, building the friend request and pinned items functionality, implementing search, creating the initial seeds file and styling icons and buttons.

### Register page that allows user to register their details.

### Login page allows user to login.

### The user's homescreen is a newsfeed which curates content specific to the user's category preferences and friends list.

### The recipe page displays all the relevant info for the recipe, including the ability to pin the recipe, like the recipe, make a comment, and edit/delete if the user is the recipe owner.

### The review page displays all the relevant info for the review, including the ability to pin the review, like the review, make a comment, and edit/delete if the user is the review owner.

### The Profile page allows the user to browse their own details, find their recipes and reviews, see their friend list, and the option to edit their details.

### Search allows the user to search the whole database for restaurants, recipes, ingredients and categories.

### The Pinned Items page allows users to see their pinned items all in one place.

### Functionality

The functionality works much the same way as most popular social network sites. Users can:

* Register & login
* Post, edit and delete your own reviews and recipe
* Search posts
* Like otherâ€™s posts
* Friend other users
* Get a curated newsfeed based on your preferences and friends
* Pin your favourite reviews & recipes

### Process
When we realised there were very few apps that incorporated both restaurant reviews and recipes (apps tend to lean to one or the other), we realised we had our USP. Once we had settled on our concept, we got to work on the

## Future Features

If we had more time essential future features we would like to add include:

* Adding an external API, such as Zomato, to display locations of restaurants.
* Ability to un-pin items and un-like reviews/recipes.
* A shopping list functionality so you could keep all the ingredients you needed for your next shop on your app.
* A simple cooking timer on the recipe pages to assist with timekeeping.
